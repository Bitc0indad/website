## Event: Nostr Q and A

Date: Dec 19, 2023, 6:00 PM PST

Description: Nostr Q and A

Nostr is more than social media. It's a censorship-resistant communications protocol that has the potential to change the Internet and maybe even the way we organize society.  I use it to write my blog. organize a meetup, create bitcoin monthly subscriptions and shop in the bitcoin circular economy and a whole lot more.

Join me to learn how to get onboard, ask me anything about it, and hang out.
