## Who we are

Who we are: A group of active members that include bitcoin and lightning developers from countries around the world. We build on multiple open source projects from the core level to the application layer.

This is a Virtual meet space for Open source developers who want to build on bitcoin and lightning related projects (include nostr/ai/hypercore, etc). While there are many spaces where developers can meet, it can be difficult to find a mentor and/or projects to start working on.

Running lightning and nostr services individually can add up to a significant VPS hosting cost. By joining the group members can try out the services at a lower cost and build immediately instead of spending time on setting things up. 

To find out more about the projects that we are working on, visit the [projects page.](/projects)
