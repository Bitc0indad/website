## **About Plebnet.Dev**

Welcome to [Plebnet.Dev](https://plebnet.dev), where the future of Bitcoin and Lightning is actively crafted. 

**What sets us apart?**

- **Mentorship and Guidance**: While there are many places bitcoin enthusiasts can congregate such as a local meetup or a bitdevs, how does one go from being a bitcoin enthusiast to an active bitcoin open source contributor? 

  If you're not experienced in open source development, how do you navigate? 

  Who do you talk to in order to start contributing? 

  Where do you start contributing? 
  
  Which project is best for me to work on?

  What skills do I need?

  It can be both intimidating and confusing. To address this big gap, we created the plebnet.dev group so that new contributors can get some guidance and mentors can help direct newcomers the best way to contribute. 

- **Active Building not Passive Learning**: One of the biggest road blocks in coding is getting stuck in tutorial hell and working in isolation while developing bad habits. An alternative way is to actively work together to build projects from the beginning and start contributing to real world projects as soon as possible. We're committed to the learn, build and feedback loop.

- **Real-time Engagement**: To get a glimpse into our activities, come to a meetup in our [discord server](https://plebnet.dev/discord) or checkout our [github](https://github.com/plebnet-dev/meeting-notes/). It offers a sneak peek into the pressing topics we discuss, the innovations we're steering, and the camaraderie we share.

- **Diverse Perspectives**: With active members hailing from various countries, our discussions are rich, our solutions innovative.

- **Cost-Effective Infrastructure**: We understand that individually running lightning and nostr services can be financially draining. That's why, by joining us, members get to utilize these services at a more economical rate, freeing up their time and resources to dive straight into building.


By joining us, you're not just participating in another developer space â€“ you're stepping into a passionate community hell-bent on driving Bitcoin and Lightning development and innovations.
