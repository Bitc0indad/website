At [Plebnet.dev](https://plebnet.dev), our aim is to continually enrich our users' experience. We're thrilled to present a new suite of resources that we believe will be invaluable for the community. While we're still in the process of organizing and perfecting how these resources will be displayed, we invite you to explore them in this interim format.

### **Resources:**

- **LNBits Testnet**  
  Explore the Lightning Network on testnet. A playground for developers and enthusiasts.
  [Check it out here](https://testnet.plebnet.dev)
- **Testnet Faucet**  
  Currently under development. In the meantime, for testnet funds, you might want to try [htlc.me](http://htlc.me/).
- **Testnet Lightning Node**  
  A comprehensive look into the Lightning Network's testnet nodes.  
  [Dive in here](https://mempool.space/testnet/lightning/node/03ba00a57cec1cef4873065ad54d0912696274cc53155b29a3b1256720e33a0943)

- **Nostr Relay**  
  An LNBits integrated relay using TESTNET sats â€“ perfect for project testing. Remember, this isn't for real transactions!  
  [Explore here](https://testnet.plebnet.dev/nostrrelay/1)

- **Signet Faucet**  
  In the pipeline. Stay tuned!

- **Nostr NIP-5 and Lightning Services**  
  For a seamless experience with Nostr, we recommend the Nostr Kit. Details coming soon.

- **Nostrogen**  
  A simple nostr vanity address generator. [Access here](https://nostrogen.plebnet.dev/)

For design enthusiasts and contributors, we're contemplating whether to list these on a separate page or to create dropdown links. Given the possible extensive nature of this list, we're inclined toward a dedicated page. However, do explore our current theme, the [astrowind template](https://astrowind.vercel.app/), and let us know what you think, especially considering the varying experiences on mobile vs. desktop.

Your feedback and suggestions drive us. We'd love to hear your thoughts on this, whether it's on [GitHub](https://github.com/plebnet-dev) or any of our other platforms.
